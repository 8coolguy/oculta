# Oculta
An encryption and authentication library. Provides encryption algorithms and can also also hash and store passwords. The purpose of this library is to setup your own authentication service similar to Cognito that you could spin and configure on your own and adapt to the cloud service of your choise. I was also just curious in implmenting popular Cryptography libraries.

## Encryption:
- RSA
- AES

## Encoding
- base64

# Auth
- sha256 hash

No Oauth2.0 for authentication with other services.
